## World of Zuul
This game is adapted from the 'World of Zuul' by Michael Kolling
and David J. Barnes. The original was written in Java and has been
simplified and converted to Python by Kingsley Sage.

The game has been extended and new features added to it make the game much more fun


Basically you just move through rooms from the outside with sourvenirs planted in some rooms waiting to be found.
